Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Before running the app, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

bash
Copy code
# Create virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. MongoDB Connection Setup
The app connects to a MongoDB database. You will need to set up a MongoDB cloud instance and store the connection URI in a .env file.

bash
Copy code
# Create a .env file in the root of your project
touch .env
Inside the .env file, add your MongoDB URI like so:

php
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<your-database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace <username>, <password>, and <your-database> with your actual MongoDB credentials and database name.

3. Dockerize the App
To containerize the application, use Docker to create an image and run the container.

3.1. Build the Docker Image
In the root of your project, run the following command to build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t diabetic-app .
3.2. Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 diabetic-app
This will start the Flask app on port 5000, and you can access it in your browser by going to http://localhost:5000.

Deployment to Render
To deploy the app on Render, follow these steps:

Push your code to GitHub:

Ensure all the necessary files (app.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, .env, etc.) are pushed to your GitHub repository.
Connect your GitHub repository to Render:

Go to Render and create an account if you haven't already.
Create a new web service on Render and connect your GitHub repository.
In the deployment settings, make sure to choose Docker as the build and run environment.
Set up environment variables on Render:

In the Environment Variables section of Render, add the MONGO_URI variable with your MongoDB URI.
Deploy the application:

Render will automatically build and deploy the app after you connect the GitHub repository. If you want to trigger a build manually, you can do so from the Render dashboard.
After deployment, your app will be live and accessible via the URL provided by Render.
Model Training
The model used for predicting diabetes risk is a Random Forest classifier. It is trained on a dataset and evaluated using accuracy score. Here's a brief overview of the training process:

Oversampling: We use the SMOTE technique to oversample the minority class in the dataset, which helps balance the classes and improve model performance.
Model Evaluation: After training the model, we evaluate it on both training and testing data to ensure it performs well.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=2)
X_resampled, Y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, Y)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, Y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=2)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Evaluate the model
X_train_prediction = rf_classifier.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_train, X_train_prediction)
print('Accuracy score of the training data: ', training_data_accuracy)

X_test_prediction = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, X_test_prediction)
print('Accuracy score of the test data: ', test_data_accuracy)
How the Flask App Works
User Input: Users can submit their health data (e.g., pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure) through the web form.
Prediction: The app uses the trained model to predict whether the user is at high risk or low risk for diabetes based on the input data.
Logging and Storing Data: The app logs the prediction results along with the user information (name, email, phone) into the MongoDB database. This is useful for tracking and analyzing past predictions.
Troubleshooting
MongoDB Connection Errors: Ensure that the MongoDB URI is correctly set in the .env file and that your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from all IP addresses.
Docker Build Issues: Ensure that your Docker environment is correctly set up and that the necessary files (like requirements.txt and app.py) are included in the Docker build context.

Model Overview
The app uses a Random Forest classifier to predict diabetes risk based on input medical data. The model is trained using the SMOTE technique to oversample the minority class and balance the dataset.

Training Process
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique): This is applied to balance the classes in the dataset by generating synthetic samples of the minority class.
Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=2)
X_resampled, Y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, Y)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, Y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=2)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Evaluate the model
X_train_prediction = rf_classifier.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_train, X_train_prediction)
print('Accuracy score of the training data: ', training_data_accuracy)

X_test_prediction = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, X_test_prediction)
print('Accuracy score of the test data: ', test_data_accuracy)
How the App Works
User Input: Users submit their medical information through a form, including data like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and more.
Prediction: The app uses the trained Random Forest model to predict whether the user is at high risk or low risk for diabetes based on the provided input.
Logging and Storing Data: The app logs the prediction along with user details (e.g., name, email, phone) in a MongoDB database for future reference.
Example Form Data:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Prediction Result:
The app predicts whether the user is at a High Risk or Low Risk for diabetes, and this result is displayed on the homepage.

Troubleshooting
MongoDB Connection Issues: Ensure that the MongoDB URI is correctly configured in the .env file and that your MongoDB cluster allows connections from all IP addresses.
Docker Build Failures: If the Docker image fails to build, ensure that your Dockerfile is correct and that all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
Flask App Not Running: Ensure that the Flask app is correctly set to run on the appropriate port (5000) and that Docker is properly exposing this port.
